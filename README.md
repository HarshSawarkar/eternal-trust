# EternalTrust - Digital Will on Hedera Hashgraph

## Project Description
EternalTrust is a digital will application designed to allow users to securely and autonomously manage asset distribution after death. By deploying smart contracts on the Hedera Hashgraph, this app aims to offer an innovative and secure way for individuals to outline and enforce post-mortem asset management without intermediaries.

## Initial Features
- **User Interface**: Simple HTML form for ease of use.
- **Wallet Connection**: Connects to individual crypto wallets on Hedera Testnet.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Allows users to deploy a smart contract with customizable parameters:
  - **Asset Upload**: Uploads at least one type of asset.
  - **Asset Division**: Permits dividing assets for distribution among multiple beneficiaries.
  - **Execution Code Generation**: Generates a unique code or hash for a lawyer or trusted person to execute the contract.

## Future Features
- **Delayed Asset Distribution**: Users can set a time delay before assets are distributed.
- **Customizable Permissions**

## Implementation Details
1. **HTML Form and Wallet Integration**: Simplified interface and integration with Hedera Testnet wallets.
2. **Smart Contract Functionality**: Uses Hedera smart contracts to securely hold and distribute assets based on conditions set by the user.
3. **Code Generation for Executors**: Generates a secure hash or code that can trigger asset distribution.

This project is the first step in exploring digital legacy and post-mortem asset ownership in the blockchain world. Join us in pioneering this future technology.
